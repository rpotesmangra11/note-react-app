## Features

- **Create Note:** Users can create a new note by clicking on the 'Create Note' button. The note will be saved and displayed in the list of notes.

- **Edit Note:** Users can edit an existing note by clicking on the note. The changes will be saved when the user clicks on the 'Done' or 'Back' button.

- **Delete Note:** Users can delete a note by clicking on the 'Delete' button. The note will be removed from the list of notes.

## Known Bugs

- **Note Deletion:** Occasionally, when a user deletes a note, the note is not immediately removed from the list of notes. The user has to refresh the page to see the updated list of notes. This will be fixed in the future (ETA uncertain).
